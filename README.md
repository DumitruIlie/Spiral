# Spiral
 
A game where you control a ball in a polar coordinate system.
Your job is simple: don't lose.
The game features 5 gamemodes:
	-endless = normal gamemode, never ending
	-rapid fire = spawns a wall every second
	-reverse = normal with controls switched
	-inside out = walls spawn at the center, extremely difficult
	-catch = you lose when a wall hits the center; you can catch the walls
The game features 15 achievements(I highly recommend not trying to get all of them):
	-That was close = survive a wall at the minimal possible distance
	-This is easy = play endless for 1 minute
	-It's getting harder = play endless for 3 minutes
	-Master of the game = play endless for 5 minutes
	-God of the impossible = play endless for 10 minutes
	-Serious dedication = have the game open for a full hour(you don't have to play a full hour)
	-No lifer = have the game open for 5 hours(you don't have to play 5 hours)
	-Machine gun = play a round of rapid fire for more than 2.5 minutes
	-RATATATA... = play a round of rapid fire for more than 5 minutes
	-One step behind the other = play a round of reverse for more than 2.5 minutes
	-Palindrome = play a round of reverse for more than 5 minutes
	-Inside out fan = play a round of inside out for more than 40 seconds(very hard and luck based)
	-Hey, son, catch! = play a round of catch for more than 2.5 minutes
	-Professional baseball mitt = play a round of catch for more than 5 minutes
	-Gotta catch 'em all = play a round of catch for more than 10 minutes

In order to function properly, the file "game_data.dat" must be in the same directory as the .exe file
